        <h1>Surfing the Web</h1>
            <h2>In the early days...</h2>
            <blockquote>“Ten years ago every web site had a section of external links because people felt it was their personal responsibility to configure the environment and build the infrastructure. The many-to-many principle showed itself in linking strategies as well. A site was not complete without links to other sites.” <br>- Olia Lialina, 2005</blockquote>
            <p>Human curated and maintaned directories were commonplace the only way to find any new sites!</p>
        <p>Webrings and external links were commonplace on personal webpages.</p>
        <h2>Early Information Retrieval Systems</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Archie</li>
            <li>Gopher</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Search Engines</h2>
        <p>User inputs a query --> search engine returns relevant hyperlinks!</p>
       
        <h3>A heavily abridged history of search engines</h3>
        <h4>1993: W3 catalog</h4>
        <p>The very first search engine! Relied primarily on the preexisting human-built lists.</p>
        <h4>Early 1990s</h4>
        <p>Web crawlers used to index the web. Engines were susceptible to certain exploits...</p>
        <h5>Web Crawlers</h5>
        <p>Bots that visit pages, follow links, and record (index) what they find!</p>
        <h4>Google changes the game with PageRank... and GoTo.com with Capitalism XP </h4>
        <p>PageRank is a search algorithm that ranks indexed sites by how many other sites link to it</p>
        <p>goto.com began the practice of offering paid search results (pay per click) for premier real estate at the top of the search results. Google and other browsers quickly followed suit.</p>
        <h4>2000s Browser Wars</h4>
        <h4>2024: Google implements AI into its search algorithm</h4>
        <h2>Death of the Human Centered Web</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Human compiled lists obsolete with the advent of effective search engines</li>
            <li>Paywalls to content</li>
            <li>Advertised search results</li>
            <li>AI search results</li>
            <li>Social media = walled garden</li>
            <li>Linkrot, see here for an <a href="http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com 
">interesting example</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Personal Web Revival?</h2>
        <p>In more recent years, people have become unsatisfied with the current state of things online! As a result, there have been active pushes to decentralize the web and make it more personal again</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Indie/personal web revival and <a href="https://neocities.org">neocities</a></li>
            <li>Webrings</li>
            <li>Revamped interest in blogs and RSS feeds</li>
            <li>Web3 discourse...</li>
            <li>Alternative search engines and methods for surfing, like <a href="https://www.marginalia.nu">Marginalia</a></li>
        </ul>
