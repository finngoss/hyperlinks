        <h1>Project Xanadu</h1>
        <p>Project Xanadu was a precursor to the WWW (World Wide Web).</p>
        <p>It was never fully integrated into the Internet.</p>
        <p>Ted Nelson emphasized the idea of “non sequential writing”, allowing users to choose their own path through selections on an e-document. </p>

        <p>In a research proposal to the <a href="https://www.acm.org/">Association for Computing Machinery</a>, he called his idea “zippered lists”.</p>
        <p>The name “Xanadu” was inspired by the poem, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43991/kubla-khan">Kubla Khan</a>, in which Xanadu is a utopian paradise city.</p>
        <p>You can see Ted’s vision of hyperlinks on <a href="https://xanadu.com/xanademos/MoeJusteOrigins.html">OpenXanadu</a>, which was later published in 2007.</p>
