        <h2>HTML: HyperText Markup Language</h2>
        <p>HTML documents are the skeleton of the web, and links are the sinews joining them together! If the web were a graph, websites are the nodes and links are the edges between them that constitute the web!</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Text that is not constrained to be linear</li>
          <li>Text that links to other text</li>
        </ul>
